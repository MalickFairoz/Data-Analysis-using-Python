    "# Introduction\n",
    "- This read me file is presented for the final project of the course **Data Analysis using Python**\n",
    "- This project is for analyzing the weather condition in 5 different cities in the United States for the period of 5 years from 2012 to 2016\n",
    "- This project is classified into 2 parts\n",
    "- The first part is to get an API key from the website \"Weather Underground\" and download the data in JSON file format using request library\n",
    "- The downloaded data will then be stored in an organized folder hierarchy also coverted to CSV file format\n",
    "- The second part will analyze this organized data in three different section\n",
    "- The analyzed output has been represented in graphs and CSV file"

    "- The API key is fetched by registering in the website \"http://api.wunderground.com/weather/api/d/docs?d=data/history&MR=1\"\n",
    "- The API key is hided using environment variable\n",
    "- A method is created to generate the date so that this can be called for everyday data generation\n",
    "- Two list are created and stored with state names and cites respectively for every city data generation\n",
    "- The data generation using request library is created under a method so that it can be called for every day's data on each city\n",
    "- The data is taken on every hour basis in a day, so the size is large for a single day file. Since we are not going to use the hour details the data is truncated with python code and stored only the required daily summary report\n",
    "- This generated data will be in JSON file format and stored in an organized folder hierarchy so that each day's data will have seperate location path\n",
    "- A method is created for scanning the location path of every JSON file and converting them to a single CSV file for each city\n",
    "- These CSV files are stored in an organized folder hierarchy\n",
    "- The data is taken for the city (Boston, Duluth, New_York, Orlando, San_Francisco)\n",
    "- The data is taken for the period from 1st Jan 2012 to 31th Dec 2016 (5 Years) for each city\n"
